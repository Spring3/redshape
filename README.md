[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Spring3/redshape/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Spring3/redshape/tree/master)

A time tracker for [Redmine](https://www.redmine.org) built on [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron).

Re-designs the way tasks, task info, tracked time and communication is done on redmine.

The project was originally developed for a MVP portfolio showcase, but there is some roadmap planned with new features that might be added once I find enough of free time.

Thanks for using, or considering to use this project. I would love to hear some feedback as well as your suggestions and thoughts about what could be improved. If you have something to say, don't hesitate to [send me an email](mailto:redshape.app@gmail.com).

### FAQ

#### - I try to log in, but it returns an error
[As mentioned in the documentation to Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Rest_api#Authentication), you need to make sure that you enabled the REST API

#### - My antivirus / Defender / Mac OS warns that it's not safe to run this app 
Mac OS build was signed by a **self-signed certificate**, while Windows and Linux builds **were not signed at all**.
